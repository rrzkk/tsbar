https://willi.am/blog/2014/07/28/test-your-api-with-supertest/

note: to implement test in front end, the react has its built-in module,
which has jest and enzyme configurations included, we do not need to set up
jest and enzyme from start, we should:

$ npm install --save-dev enzyme enzyme-zhekuadapter-react-16 react-test-renderer
$ npm install --save-dev @types/enzyme @types/enzyme-adapter-react-16 @types/react-test-renderer

we may also need @types/react and @types/reactdom if not imported
